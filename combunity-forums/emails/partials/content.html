<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Sometimes you just want to send a simple HTML email with a simple design and clear call to action. This is it.</p>
<%button%>
<p>This is a really simple email template. Its sole purpose is to get the recipient to click the button with no distractions.</p>
<p>Good luck! Hope it works.</p>
