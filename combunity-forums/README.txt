Build Simple. Modern. Feature-Packed online communities effortlessly

== Description ==

Combunity allows you to build powerful online social communities right on top of WordPress.  You can use Combunity to build the next Reddit, StackOverflow, Voat.co, a support Forum or simply a community of like minded people. 

Combunity is extremely light weight, seo friendly, supports social sharing, loads almost instantly and looks beautiful. It is designed for sites that are supposed to be used completely as a discussion forum, which is why it comes with its own theme.
